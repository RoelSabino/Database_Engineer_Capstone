Please run the sql queries in mySQL first before running the last statement in the Jupyter Notebook file. 
Otherwise the output of the last select statement will be empty:

1. sql_PopulateCustomers.sql
2. sql_PopulateOrders.sql




More notes:
-----------
- In the folder are complete project files with saved mySQL Workbench file, Tableau file and Jupyter Notebook file. 
- Run the sql_ForwardEngineer.sql script in mySQL Workbench to deploy the database "little_lemon"
- In my testserver, user name = "roel", password = "", please change to your local server authentication accordingly
- There are images files of the steps taken. 
- Separate sql scripts are saved for inspection and/or execution. 


Thanks!
